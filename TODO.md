# TODO
John wants this "dusted off for BlackHat". These updates may constitute v3, but I'm not sure yet. This is what he wants done:

### Document and Spreadsheet Tracking
I will need to get HoneyBadger working to track when a document or spreadsheet is opened and by whom.

This will likely be in conjunction with Canarytokens.

### Python 3 Upgrade
I would like to upgrade HoneyBadger to use Python 3

### Metasploit Module Fix
I would eventually like to fix the Metasploit auxiliary modules to work with the latest version(s) of the project. This is not a top priority for BlackHat, but would be good fun.
